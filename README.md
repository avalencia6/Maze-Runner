Maze Runner on mBed

I completed this project for my Programming Hardware/Software class. This project involved creating a version of the classic Labyrinth marble game in which you move a steel ball around a maze of potholes to get to an end goal. I created three levels of the game, each with increased difficulty. I also added the ability to skip levels or jump back to a ball's previous position along with a score that scales to how much time is taken to complete the game. 


After implementing the basic requirements, I decided to add some extra features for fun. These included more level elements such as a slow zone, a guard, and portals. I also included a start menu which allowed the user to select the difficulty of the game. This affected the speed and acceleration of the ball's movement along with the difficulty posed by my extra level elements. Lastly, I implemented a "stop" feature that had one use per level: this allowed the user to press a push button, instantly reducing the ball's velocity and acceleration to zero. 


Some hardware features of this game include an LED display, four push buttons to implement things such as the "stop" feature, start menu control, and skip/jump functionality, a temperature sensor which increased the rate at which score points were lost, a speaker for sound effects, and an LED light indicating whether or not the ball was currently in a slow zone.
